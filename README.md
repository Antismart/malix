# **MaliX: Decentralized Intellectual Property Platform**

MaliX is a decentralized platform that allows creators to tokenize, sell, and license their intellectual property (IP) using blockchain technology. By minting IP as NFTs, creators can easily register ownership, manage sales, and earn royalties on secondary transactions. The platform is designed to provide a secure, transparent, and user-friendly marketplace for intellectual property.

2. **IP Registration & Tokenization**: Creators can mint intellectual property (IP) as NFTs, ensuring verifiable proof of ownership on the blockchain.
3. **IP Listing for Sale**: Creators can list their IP for sale with a set price, enabling buyers to purchase IP via smart contracts.
4. **Purchasing IP**: Buyers can purchase IP, and ownership is automatically transferred via smart contracts.
5. **Royalties System**: Creators earn a percentage of sales on secondary transactions through an automated royalty system.
